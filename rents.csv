"This section provides detailed information about the rented property, including its complete address, dimensions, and any specific features or amenities provided. Specifying the details of the property ensures clarity regarding the premises being rented. It helps prevent misunderstandings and disputes regarding the identity or condition of the property.

"This clause outlines the duration of the tenancy, including the start date and end date of the lease period. It may also include provisions for renewal or termination of the agreement. Clearly defining the term of the tenancy helps establish the period during which the landlord agrees to lease the property to the tenant and the corresponding rights and obligations of both parties during this period. The duration of the tenancy is governed by the Indian Easements Act, 1882, which allows for leases of immovable property for a fixed term."
"This clause specifies the monthly rent amount payable by the tenant, the due date for rent payment, accepted modes of payment, and any penalties for late payments. Clearly outlining the rent amount and payment terms helps prevent disputes and ensures regular and timely payment of rent by the tenant. Rent agreements adhere to Section 105 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, which defines leases as transfers of a right to enjoy the property for a certain time, in consideration of a price paid or promised."
"This clause outlines the amount of security deposit required from the tenant, conditions for its refund upon the termination of the tenancy, and any deductions for damages or outstanding dues. The security deposit serves as a safeguard for the landlord against potential damages to the property or non-payment of rent by the tenant. Clearly defining the terms related to the security deposit helps protect the interests of both parties. Security deposit terms are governed by Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, which allows landlords to demand security deposits as collateral against potential damages or unpaid rent."
"This clause delineates the responsibilities of both parties regarding property maintenance, repairs, and upkeep, distinguishing between major repairs (landlord's responsibility) and minor repairs (tenant's responsibility). Clearly defining maintenance and repair responsibilities helps prevent misunderstandings and disputes regarding the upkeep of the property during the tenancy. Maintenance obligations are derived from Section 108(a) of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, which mandates that landlords must maintain leased properties in a habitable condition."
"This clause outlines any restrictions on the tenant's use of the property, such as prohibitions on subletting, conducting illegal activities, or making structural alterations without permission. Imposing reasonable restrictions on the use of the property helps protect the landlord's interests and maintain the property's condition and value. Restrictions on property use are based on Section 108(e) of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, which allows landlords to impose reasonable restrictions to protect their interests."
" This clause details the procedure for terminating the tenancy, including the required notice period for both parties and conditions under which the agreement may be terminated. Clearly outlining the termination procedure helps ensure a smooth transition at the end of the tenancy and facilitates the resolution of any disputes that may arise regarding the termination of the agreement. Termination clauses are governed by both the terms of the agreement and relevant provisions of the Indian Easements Act, 1882, which specify the conditions under which leases may be terminated."
